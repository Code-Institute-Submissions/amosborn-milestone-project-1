# David Gray Website
### Code Institute User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

This project is a website for a band (musician).  It is intended to showcase the subject's music as well as providing the user with information about his musical background, details of upcoming tours and a contact form to sign up to receive updates.

## UX

This website is designed for fans of David Gray, new and old, to access information easily with a user-friendly design.

As a fan, the website provides an overview of the musician's career, music and video that can be played on the site, links to buy concert tickets and a form to sign up to receive news.

## Features

This website uses Spotify to allow the user to play music without having to leave the site.

Bootstrap Javascript was also used for the collapsable navbar on smaller screens.

## Technologies Used

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Bootstrap 4.3.1

## Testing

The user story of music fans has the intended results as it gives them some background about the artist, showcases his music and video and provides a form to sign up. The social media icons in the footer provide links to further sources of information.

All external links use target="_blank" to open in a new tab and all links have been tested to ensure the go to the correct webpages.

The form has been tested so if fields are left blank or the email field has the incorrect format of an email address an error message will be displayed  and the form will not submit.

The links in the navbar have also been tested so they link to the correct part of the page.

The site has been tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers and on Samsung S111 and Motorola mobiles, Acer tablet and Dell laptop.

## Deployment

This website is hosted on Github pages. It is deployed from the master branch. The HTML page is called index.html in order to run on Github Pages.
